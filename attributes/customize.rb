# Override the cookbook's default attributes in this file.
#
# Usually, you don't change this file directly, but you'll create a "elasticsearch/attributes/customize.rb" file
# in your wrapper cookbook and put the overrides in that file.
#
# The following shows how to override the Elasticsearch version and cluster name settings:
#
# normal[:elasticsearch142][:version] = '1.1.0'
# normal[:elasticsearch142][:cluster][:name] = 'my-cluster'
